;; You enter a large cavern full of rare bioluminescent dumbo octopuses! They seem to not like the Christmas lights on your submarine, so you turn them off for now.

;; There are 100 octopuses arranged neatly in a 10 by 10 grid. Each octopus slowly gains energy over time and flashes brightly for a moment when its energy is full. Although your lights are off, maybe you could navigate through the cave without disturbing the octopuses if you could predict when the flashes of light will happen.

;; Each octopus has an energy level - your submarine can remotely measure the energy level of each octopus (your puzzle input). For example:

;; 5483143223
;; 2745854711
;; 5264556173
;; 6141336146

;; 2176841721
;; 6882881134
;; 4846848554
;; 5283751526

;; The energy level of each octopus is a value between 0 and 9. Here, the top-left octopus has an energy level of 5, the bottom-right one has an energy level of 6, and so on.
